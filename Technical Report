    Using Github for collaboration.

    SRT-simulator:

        Main.java:
            Main function to take in test data using Srt class(see Srt.java).

        Srt.java:
            A java class takes in two parameters: String dividend, String divisor.
            The dividend and divisor in string format will be first converted into
            stringbuilder and passed into function HexToBin.
                HexToBin function takes in stringbuilder. First, check if the input is in binary format (user can choose to
                input number in binary format by adding "(binary)" after the number). If if's binary then it return the
                binary value to binSB and get rid of the postfix at the same time. If it's in hex format then
                it will convert it into binary and return to the binSB.
            After conversion, function normalize is called for normalize the dividend.
            After previous steps, go through the loop for the repeating sequences:
